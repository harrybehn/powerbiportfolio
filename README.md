## Steps followed 

### Step 1 : 
- **Load data into Power BI Desktop**.
- I use excel files in this project but in my actual work I would extract data from sql server and I would usually use native query for optimization.
- I used three datasets for this project namely, PlayerGamingSession1, Player, Nationality and PlayerGamingSession2. 
- PlayerGamingSession1 contains the columns PlayerID, Win(Actual Win), TheoWin, GamingArea, GameType and Dateplayed.
- PlayerGamingSession2 contains the columns PlayerID, Win(Actual Win), TheoWin, GamingArea, GameType, Month and Year.
- Player contains columns PlayerID and NationalityCode. Nationality contains columns NationalityCode and description.

### Step 2 :
- **Merge Queries**.
-  Next step is to merge Nationality table to Player table using the nationalitycode column to get the nationality description.
- Then merge Player table to PlayerGamingSession1 and PlayerGamingSession2. Close and Apply.

### Step 3 : Weekly Monitoring
### Step 3.1
- **Create Calculated Columns**.
- Create NationalityGroup column to group the nationaties into Philippines, USA and others.

- Create DateRange column to compare weekly performance. I used a fixed date in this project but in my work I use a dynamic date using this dax formula: Yesterday = today() - 1, P1W = today() - 8, ..etc.
